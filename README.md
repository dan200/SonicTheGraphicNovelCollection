# Sonic the Graphic Novel Collection

*Sonic the Graphic Novel Collection* is a fan project to recompile the stories from the 1990's UK comic [Sonic the Comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Comic) into a standalone graphic novel format, complete with new front and back covers, contents pages, and improved image quality. Check out [the previews section of this page](#previews) to see what this looks like!

The presentation of these graphic novels is inspired by [The Judge Dredd Case Files](https://shop.2000ad.com/catalogue/graphic-novels/dredd-case-files): Stories that were originally split into multiple parts have been joined back together, spin-off stories have been carefully placed to flow seamlessly with the main strip, and unrelated articles and adverts have been removed. All in all: these novels aim to be the best possible way to read the comic stories from *Sonic the Comic*.

## How to Read

The plan is to release new volumes gradually over the next few months until every single story has been collected, so watch this space!
