# Sonic the Graphic Novel Collection

Sonic the Graphic Novel Collection is a fan project to recompile the stories from the UK comics publication [Sonic the Comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Comic) into a standalone Graphic Novel format, complete with new front and back covers, contents pages, and improved image quality. Check [the images at the bottom of this page](#preview) for a preview of what this looks like!

The presentation of these graphic novels is broadly inspired by [The Complete Judge Dredd Case Files](https://shop.2000ad.com/catalogue/graphic-novels/dredd-case-files): Stories that were originally split into multiple parts have been joined back together, spin-off stories have been carefully positioned for the best continuity with the main strip, and unrelated articles and adverts have been removed. In all: these novels aim to be the best possible way to experience the comics content from Sonic the Comic.

## How to read

To read Sonic the Graphic Novel collection, you will first need to acquire copies of Sonic the Comic, Sonic the Poster Mag and the Summer/Holiday specials. These are not redistributed here, but can be found on [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22sonic%20the%20comic%20book%20collection%22). Once you have downloaded these issues, perform the following steps:

1. Download this GitHub repository by clicking "Code > Download ZIP" in the top right corner of this page.
2. Extract the .ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Create a subfolder called "issues", and place all of your downloaded .cbz files into this folder.
4. Double-click "Export.bat". You will be asked whether you would like to enhance the image quality on your comic files. This is optional, but will greatly improve the image quality of your comics. Press Y or N to choose.
5. When the export process completes, you will find your new graphic novel files in a newly created "volumes" folder, ready to read with the CBZ reader of your choice.

## Project Status

Right now, five volumes of Sonic the Graphic Novel collection have been compiled, collecting the Sonic, Knuckles and "Sonic's World" stories from the first 100 issues of Sonic the Comic and it's spin-offs. The plan is to release new volumes gradually over the next few months until all of Sonic the Comic has been compiled.
