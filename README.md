# Sonic the Graphic Novel Collection

Sonic the Graphic Novel Collection is a fan project to recompile the stories from the UK comics publication [Sonic the Comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Comic) into a standalone Graphic Novel format, complete with new front and back covers, contents pages, and improved image quality. Check the images at the bottom of this page for a preview of what this looks like!

The presentation of these graphic novels is broadly inspired by [Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files](https://shop.2000ad.com/catalogue/graphic-novels/dredd-case-files): Stories that were originally split into multiple parts have been joined back together, spin-off stories have been carefully positioned for continuity with the main strip, and unrelated articles and adverts have been removed. In all: this project aims to be the best possible way to experience the stories from Sonic the Comic.

## How to read

To read Sonic the Graphic Novel collection, you will first need to aquire copies of Sonic the Comic, Sonic the Poster Mag and the Sonic specials. These are not redistributed here due to their copyright status, but can be found on [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=sonic%20the%20comic). Once you have aquired these issues, perform the following steps:

1. Download this GitHub repository, by clicking "Code > Download ZIP" in the top right corner.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
3. Create a subfolder called "issues", and place all of your downloaded comic .cbz files into this folder.
4. Double-click "Export.bat". You will be asked whether you would like to run image enhancement on your comic files. This is optional, but will greatly improve the image quality of your comics.
5. When the export process completes, you will find your new graphic novel files in the "volumes" folder ready to read with any CBZ reader.

## Project Status

Right now, five volumes of Sonic the Graphic Novel collection have been compiled, collecting the Sonic, Knuckles and "Sonic's World" stories from the first 100 issues of Sonic the Comic and it's spin-off publications. The plan is to release new volumes gradually over the next few months until all of Sonic the Comic has been compiled.
